This session conducted for staff at [Habilitat: Long-term Addiction Treatment](https://www.habilitat.com/) and [Hawaiʻi Appleseed: Center for Law and Economic Justice](https://hiappleseed.org/) introduced R and RStudio with start-up scripts for data importing, cleaning, manipulating, and visualizing. Designed for staff with
no coding experience, we started with how to download and install R and RStudio, how to create a new RProject, and best practices in data management for R. 

We then took a tour of the RStudio interface, and practiced with two start-up scripts: one looking at IRS data on Hawaiʻi nonprofits, and one using an API to download data directly from the US Census.
