Abstract: Understanding the linguistic diversity within communities has become pivotal for effective social sector decision-making in the US. This talk introduces, LanguageFinder, which serves as a bridge to unlock critical insights from the US Census Language Data.

This discussion centers on the urgent need to identify languages spoken, beyond English, in specific locales and to harness translation and interpretation services as pivotal instruments for equitable access to information. Recognizing the significance of information accessibility, particularly in contexts such as disaster warnings, healthcare, local government engagement, environmental justice, and workplace safety, this talk explores the potential impact of linguistic inclusivity.

The tool enables users to discover the languages spoken in distinct geographic areas, offering valuable insights into language distribution across the United States. Social sector organizations catering to linguistically diverse communities can strategically identify their key service areas through this language data, thereby enhancing the precision and effectiveness of their outreach and engagement efforts.

"LanguageFinder" serves as a catalyst for social sector decision-makers, researchers, and community leaders to harness the power of language data, fostering a more inclusive, accessible, and responsive approach to meet the needs of diverse populations across the nation.
