I had the pleasure of visiting the inaugural class "Sustainability Innovation I" in the Department of Environmental Studies in Fall 2023 to conduct a workshop for the students on Implementing Design Thinking for sustainability entrepreneurship. 

We covered how to use Design Thinking with a Systems Change lens, and the students had a chance to apply the concepts to their course projects supporting local small businesses in Honolulu with sustainable innovation.
