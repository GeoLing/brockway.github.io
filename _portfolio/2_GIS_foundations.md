I developed and instructed the first ever UNITAR/NSF Short Course hosted by Chaminade University of Honolulu. [GIS for Sustainability and Resilience in the Pacific](https://chaminade.edu/58083-2/) 
is an interdisciplinary course exploring the application of geospatial data and technologies to address pressing issues of sustainability and resilience in the Pacific region. 
As the Pacific region faces unique challenges related to climate change, environmental conservation, disaster preparedness, and social equity, geospatial data and strategies 
play a pivotal role in developing effective solutions. This course equips students with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate these complex issues.

This class is more conceptual than technical in nature, and is focused on:  
1. Using systems thinking to determine appropriate indicators of sustainability and/or resilience in particular systems and geographies (in the Pacific) of interest to each student. 
1. Identifying and evaluating existing geospatial data relevant to key indicators. 
1. Identifying and overcoming barriers to the use of geospatial data for measuring sustainability and/or resiliency in Pacific geographies of interest. 

Who Should Attend: This course is ideal for students and professionals interested in environmental conservation, disaster management, climate resilience, geopolitics, 
and social development in the Pacific region. It is also valuable for those pursuing careers in geospatial data science and its applications. 

Learning outcomes: 
1.	Discuss the unique considerations of geospatial data; 
1.	Identify the value of geospatial data for sustainability and resilience; 
1.	Search for and access existing geospatial datasets; 
1.	Scope geospatial data challenges in Pacific Islands and support the development of effective policy for enabling data environments; 
1.	Improve the capacity of their organization and/or community for the future of geospatial data use
