In this holistic assessment of Native Hawaiian well-being, I pitched in with data validation, data visualization, writing, and editing. I learned from some amazing researchers, editors, and programmers along the way.

[Ka Huaka‘i 2021](https://www.ksbe.edu/ka-huakai) is a centerpiece of Kamehameha Schools' publications on Native Hawaiian education and well-being.

As an example of ʻŌiwi scholarship, this volume contextualizes recent research and data using the “Pua Model” to examine Native Hawaiian strengths and well-being in multiple dimensions: social, physical, educational, material/economic, and spiritual/emotional. ‘Ike is presented at the macro level—for the lāhui and Ka Pae ‘Āina Hawai‘i—and by specific regions and age groups.

Findings point to both positive gains and persistent challenges for Kānaka Maoli, highlighting the importance of Hawaiian culture-based education as a pathway for learners to build a bright future for generations to come.
