I can support the evaluation and reporting of your project or program for any type of evaluation audience and at any stage of the project. 
I help to identify stakeholders and their information needs, and determine the appropriate report format(s). What might be useful to one stakeholder may not be useful to another. 
Reporting has many potential purposes and may need to be presented in multiple formats to accomplish its objectives. 
Formats could include data dashboards, PowerPoint presentations, one-page summaries, or more formal written reports. 
My expertise in data visualization is particularly helpful when sharing findings in evaluation reports.
