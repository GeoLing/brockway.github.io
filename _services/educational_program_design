Many non-profits engage in educational programs to engage the community, build awareness of key aspects of their mission, and close knowledge gaps within their target stakeholder groups. 
Educational programs are often time- and resource-intensive, so strategic program design (and redesign!) is critical to ensure that programs are both impactful and sustainable.
