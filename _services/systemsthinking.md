What is Systems Change? Here are some of my favorite definitions:

Systems change is “the reconfiguration of a system, including its component parts and the interactions between these parts, such that it leads to the formation of a new system that behaves in a qualitatively different way” from the [Systems Change Lab](https://systemschangelab.org/what-is-systems-change) 

"Systems change is about advancing equity by shifting the conditions that hold a problem in place." from FSG's [The Waters of Systems Change](https://www.fsg.org/resource/water_of_systems_change/)

Pursuing systems change requires us to develop our skill in systems thinking, a perspective that sees the world as a complex web of interconnected systems. By embracing key concepts of systems thinking, individuals and organizations can identify and influence key leverage points, barriers to change, and sources of power within a target system.
