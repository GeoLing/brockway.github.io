What is Systems Change? Here are some of my favorite definitions:

Systems change is “the reconfiguration of a system, including its component parts and the interactions between these parts, such that it leads to the formation of a new system that behaves in a qualitatively different way” from the [Systems Change Lab](https://systemschangelab.org/what-is-systems-change) 

"Systems change is about advancing equity by shifting the conditions that hold a problem in place." from FSG's [The Waters of Systems Change](https://www.fsg.org/resource/water_of_systems_change/)

Pursuing systems change requires us to develop our skill in systems thinking, a perspective that sees the world as a complex web of interconnected systems. By embracing key concepts of systems thinking, individuals and organizations can identify and influence key leverage points, barriers to change, and sources of power within a target system. I also believe that Diffusion of Innovations Theory is crucial to strategies that involve changing mindsets and behaviors. I use the term "innovation" to mean ideas that are new, or not currently in use, in the target population, even if those ideas have been around for millenia.

What I provide
======

- Strategic planning for systems change capacity building within organizations and across networks

- Coaching on key elements and analytical methods of systems thinking for systems change

- Consulting around how to apply innovation diffusion principles to drive and sustain social and behavioral innovation

What you provide
======

- Access to stakeholders for information-gathering and strategic discussions

Key Components
======

- Defining the target system and its environment
- System mapping: resource flows, actor maps, causal loop diagramming, pattern recognition
- Analyzing differences between social structures and communication structures
- Understanding system stability and resistance to change
- Uncovering patterns of innovators, early adopters, and social capital
- Choosing appropriate time horizons
- Using system feedback to drive change in the right direction
- Applying the "Principle of Leverage" to system interventions and identifying conditions of systems change
- Estimating and tracking potential tipping points and critical mass
- Learning to "dance" with systems rather than trying to control or predict them
- Identifying potential side-effects of system interventions
