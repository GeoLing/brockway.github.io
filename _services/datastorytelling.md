Effective data storytelling is a powerful way to share your organization's impact. Funding sources, non-profit boards, current and potential employees, 
service recipients, and small donors all want to see that your organization is fulfilling its mission, staying true to its values, and using resources responsibly. 
Data can help you tell this story, but sometimes you might need help to ensure that story you are telling is truly supported by the data you are using, 
and that your target audience will interpret the data in the way you expect.
